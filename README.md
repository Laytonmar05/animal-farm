# animalfarm
An application to demonstrate manipulation of DOM objects (html elements)


- Scaffold project
  - create index.html file
  - create css file in its own directory
  - create a js file in its own directory
  - reference both from html
  - proof of life for css and js


- We need some kind of containers to represent the circles - section
- Need an h1 to hold the title - h1
- Probably need a big container to hold all of the animals - "farm" - div
